Assingment for the Videogames and Entertainment Software 20/21 subject of the University of Oviedo.

This little project intends to be a very light version of The Binding of Isaac with the player control of Enter the Gungeon. That's it.

The game will feature unlimited floors made with interconnected rooms filled with enemies. Killing those enemies and entering treasure rooms will gain upgrades to the player.
The game will be a complete rogue-like, dying in the game means the lost of all the progress made. Each run is a completely new run.
The goal is to reach the deepest floor you can killing the bosses of each one and getting access to the next one.

The dgame is developed in C++ only using the SDL2 library for handling audio and grahpics, that's all. Everything else will be pure manfactured C++.
